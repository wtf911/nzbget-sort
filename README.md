# nzbget-sort
Sort files inside of a NZB prior to adding them to your NZBGet queue.

# Explanation
When trying to stream archived files with NZBGet it is important that the files are downloaded in order.
This script alphabetizes the order of files inside of a NZB and then, if one exists, places the .rar at the beginning.

# Usage
First, you will likely want to get a script for streaming with NZBGet:

https://github.com/BlkChockr/nzbget-stream

Then, along with that script, you will place this inside of your NZBGet scripts folder and reload NZBGet.

Lastly, add this under Settings > Extensions Scripts > Extensions inside of NZBGet.
